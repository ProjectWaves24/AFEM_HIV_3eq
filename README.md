# AFEM_HIV_3eq

The repository contains code for solution of parameter identification problem for the model problem of 3 ODE using clinical data of 4 patients.
 The  code implements a time-adaptive optimization approach for determining the
time-dependent immune response function in a mathematical model of
acute HIV infection, using clinical data from four untreated patients.


Results obtained by the MATLAB code are reported in the paper:
